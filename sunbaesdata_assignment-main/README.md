To run this project, start by creating a new project using Spring Initializer. Include the required dependencies, such as Spring MVC, and add the remaining dependencies in the pom.xml file.

In the src/main/java directory, create the necessary components: controller, service, and other required code as provided in the above files. Ensure the HTML files are placed in the following paths:

Static HTML files: src/main/resources/static/create.html, src/main/resources/static/update.html, src/main/resources/static/login.html
Thymeleaf template: src/main/resources/templates/getdetaillist.html
Once the project is set up correctly, run the main application and paste the generated URL into your browser. This will initiate and display the application.
